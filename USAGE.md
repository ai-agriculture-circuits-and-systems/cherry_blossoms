 # Cherry Blossoms Dataset Usage Guide

This document outlines various applications and usage examples for the Cherry Blossoms dataset.

## Applications

### 1. Climate Change Research
- Study long-term temperature trends in Japan
- Analyze the relationship between global warming and flowering patterns
- Investigate climate variability over centuries
- Compare historical temperature reconstructions with modern measurements

### 2. Phenological Studies
- Track changes in flowering dates over time
- Study the impact of temperature on plant phenology
- Investigate seasonal pattern shifts
- Analyze the relationship between temperature and flowering timing

### 3. Cultural and Historical Research
- Study the cultural significance of cherry blossoms in Japanese society
- Investigate historical weather patterns and their impact on agriculture
- Analyze the relationship between climate and historical events
- Study the evolution of Japanese seasonal traditions

### 4. Machine Learning Applications
- Develop models to predict flowering dates
- Create temperature reconstruction models
- Analyze temporal patterns in phenological data
- Build climate change prediction models

## Data Usage Examples

### 1. Basic Data Loading
```python
import tensorflow_datasets as tfds

# Load the dataset
dataset = tfds.load('cherry_blossoms', split='train')

# Convert to pandas DataFrame
import pandas as pd
df = tfds.as_dataframe(dataset)
```

### 2. Temperature Analysis
```python
# Calculate average March temperatures by century
df['century'] = df['year'] // 100
century_temps = df.groupby('century')['temp'].mean()
```

### 3. Flowering Date Analysis
```python
# Calculate average flowering dates by century
century_doy = df.groupby('century')['doy'].mean()

# Calculate trend in flowering dates
from scipy import stats
slope, intercept, r_value, p_value, std_err = stats.linregress(df['year'], df['doy'])
```

## Best Practices

1. **Data Quality**
   - Consider the confidence intervals (temp_upper and temp_lower) when analyzing temperature data
   - Be aware of potential gaps in historical records
   - Account for measurement methods changing over time

2. **Analysis Considerations**
   - Use appropriate statistical methods for time series data
   - Consider seasonal adjustments when analyzing trends
   - Account for urban heat island effects in modern measurements

3. **Visualization**
   - Use appropriate time scales for different analyses
   - Include confidence intervals in temperature visualizations
   - Consider using seasonal decomposition for trend analysis

## Limitations

1. **Data Coverage**
   - Some historical periods may have sparse data
   - Modern measurements may be affected by urban development
   - Temperature reconstructions have varying confidence levels

2. **Interpretation**
   - Consider the historical context when interpreting data
   - Account for changes in measurement methods
   - Be aware of potential biases in historical records
